This approach not only ensures universal accessibility but also leverages the widespread availability of web browsers to foster innovation and learning. Within this framework, the selection of Three.js as our visualization engine is crucial. Its advanced rendering capabilities enable us to present complex visualizations with high fidelity, which is essential for a great user experience and particularly vital for sim-to-real applications that rely on computer vision. The recent integration of WebGPU further enhances these visualizations, offering unparalleled performance and efficiency in a web environment. By focusing on browser-based accessibility and leveraging the visualization strengths of Three.js, we prioritize ease of access and the quality of user experience, ensuring that our platform is a versatile and powerful tool for anyone interested in exploring the future of robotics."
